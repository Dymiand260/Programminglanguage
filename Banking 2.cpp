  In this assignment, You are asked to collaborate with Airgead Banking, 
  one of Chada Techâ€™s clients. Airgead Banking is well known in the community. 
  They often sponsor schools and have recently decided to partner with the local high school to 
  develop a program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility 
  (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system. 
  The initial focus for this project will be on investing and the power of compound interest. 
  You will develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. 
  Airgead Banking has provided you with a list of functional requirements that describe what they need their 
  application to do.
